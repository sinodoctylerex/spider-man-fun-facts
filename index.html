    Peter Parker is a huge fan of everything that comes out of Aunt May's kitchen, but his absolute favorite has to be her cherry pie.<br> Thank goodness he didn't inherit a spider's taste for insects along with its powers.<br>
    Bitten by a radioactive spider, Peter Parker's arachnid abilities give him amazing powers he uses to help others, while his personal life continues to offer plenty of obstacles.<br> With amazing spider-like abilities, teenage science whiz Peter Parker fights crime and dreams of becoming an Avenger as Spider-Man.<br>
    Generally speaking, Spider-Man is popular because in many respects he was the most relatable hero to the majority of comic book readers back in the heyday of comics (1965 to 1985).<br>
    We all expect and with certainty know that Tobey Maguire is THE best Spiderman.<br> He was and remains the best spiderman actor to have fought crimes on screen in that very rousing red and blue suit.<br> In the year 2002, the first instalment of the to-be world-famous and stem-wending trilogy of Spiderman was released<br>
    despite all the challenges he faces Spider-Man is always committed to helping others and often puts his personal life at risk to do so.<br>
